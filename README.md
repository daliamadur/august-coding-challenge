# august-coding-challenge
A 31 day long coding challenge I completed during August 2024 to sharpen my fundamentals and learn key coding skills and concepts

## ðŸ“œ Objective 
The goal of this challenge was to build a habit of consistently solving coding problems, since I don't code much outside of my degree content and want to improve my skills, efficiency and knowledge.  The problems progress in difficulty week by week and cover topics such as data structures and basic algorithms

## ðŸ’¾ Technologies used
